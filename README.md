## Introduction

# Secure-AI
This repository contains submission for the 2020 Facebook developers circle community challenge. We will be discussing about privacy preserving machine learning tools built on top of pytorch alongside tutorials for technical implementations.

# Overview
The exponential growth of data is overwhelming and data nowadays is basically ubiquitous. Considering the ground-breaking achievements and breakthrough in Artificial intelligence such as deep learning due to the rise and access to compute instances in order to run large training jobs of deep neural networks on the cloud, now is the time to take a look into how AI systems are being developed, how secure these systems are, 

This lesson we will tackle lowering some of the potential implications and challenges posed by training Deep neural network on distributed data and AI as well as principles for building responsible AI that is secure to avoid harming others amd protecting privacy of data.
