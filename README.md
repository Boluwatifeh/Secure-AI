## Introduction

# Secure-AI

This repository contains submission for the 2020 Facebook developers circle community challenge. We will be discussing about privacy preserving machine learning tools built on top of pytorch alongside tutorials for technical implementations.

# Overview

The exponential growth of data is overwhelming and data nowadays is basically ubiquitous. Considering the ground-breaking achievements and breakthrough in Artificial intelligence such as deep learning due to the rise and access to compute instances in order to run large training jobs of deep neural networks on the cloud, now is the time to take a look into how AI systems are being developed and how privacy-preserving these systems are. Deep learning is a form of machine  learning which is an exciting domain with a very huge potential, it is fast-growing with wide-array of cutting edge applications in self-driving cars, cancer detection, NLP and speech recognition. The heart of an optimized model is 'data', your model is as good as the data it's being trained on and as ML is hungry for data, we currently do not have a data lake/bank that contains accurate set of data that can utilized for training effective ML models, as such data are often collected from users of a product which often contain sensitive information of these users thereby invading privacy. What if we could train models and perform statistical analysis on distributed data without compromising privacy? 

  Data privacy has been a major concern for tech companies and individuals since the GDPR legislation in may 2018. Therefore, it's imperative for data scientists, machine learning engineers researchers and tech companies to be aware of user's privacy while going about collecting data in the ML pipeline either for analysis, training or some other business oriented reasons. 

This lesson we will tackle lowering some of the potential implications and challenges posed by training Deep neural network on distributed data and AI as well as principles for building responsible AI that is secure to avoid harming others amd protecting privacy of data.
